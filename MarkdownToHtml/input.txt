This paragraph of text,
## contains two lines.

    # It might look like a headline.
But no, it's a paragraph starting with `#.

#And it's not a headline.

###### Headlines can be multi-line.
(and with skipping headings on previous levels).

We all like to *select* text in _different_ ways.
**Highlighting**, is used much less frequently,
but __why not__?
A little --drawing out-- has never hurt anyone.
The code is represented by the `code` element.

Notice how the special
HTML characters such as `<`, `>` and `&`.

Did you know that in Markdown, single * and _
do not stand for selection?
They can also be escaped
with a backslash: \*.



Unnecessary empty lines should be ignored.

Do you love *nested __selections__*
like __--I do--__?
