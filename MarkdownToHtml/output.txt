<h1>First level header</h1>
<h2>Second level header</h2>
<h3>Third ## level header</h3>
<h4>Fourth level header
## Still fourth ##</h4>
<p>This paragraph of text,
## contains two lines.</p>
<p>    # It might look like a headline.
But no, it's a paragraph starting with `#.</p>
<p>#And it's not a headline.</p>
<h6>Headlines can be multi-line.
(and with skipping headings on previous levels).</h6>
<p>We all like to <em>select</em> text in <em>different</em> ways.
<strong>Highlighting</strong>, is used much less frequently,
but <strong>why not</strong>?
A little <s>drawing out</s> has never hurt anyone.
The code is represented by the <code>code</code> element.</p>
<p>Notice how the special
HTML characters such as <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code>.</p>
<p>Did you know that in Markdown, single * and _
do not stand for selection?
They can also be escaped
with a backslash: *.</p>
<p>Unnecessary empty lines should be ignored.</p>
<p>Do you love <em>nested <strong>selections</strong></em>
like <strong><s>I do</s></strong>?</p>
